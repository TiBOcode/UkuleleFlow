    question: "How long are the sessions?",
    answer: "Each session is 40m, personalized instruction. This gives us enough time to connect and feels short enough to prevent feeling overwhelmed."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need my own ukulele?",
    answer: "Yes, you'll need your own ukulele. We will definitely take time to chat about You, Music and Creativity but ultimately we will end up playing, practicing and having fun. So keep your instrument nearby!"
  },
  {
    question: "What skill level is required?",
    answer: "Ukulele Flow is a unique playstyle therefore all levels are welcome! It doesn't matter if you've just started a week ago or if you have been playing guitar 25 years ago."
  },
  {
    question: "How do we meet?",
    answer: "There are plenty of great options: Online through Video Call, Zoom or Whatsapp. Anything works!"
  },
  {
    question: "What's the teaching philosophy behind Ukulele Flow ?",
    answer: "I focus on developing your creative expression and connection with music rather than just learning songs. I use mindfulness and flow techniques to deepen the relationship with your instrument."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need to reschedule a lesson?",
    answer: "Life happens! Just give 24 hours notice and we can easily reschedule your session to a more convenient time."
  },
  {
    question: "How long until I see progress?",
    answer: "Students typically start experiencing shifts in their playing and musical connection within the first few sessions. Since Ukulele Flow emphasizes personal expression, you'll notice progress in both technical skills and creative confidence."
