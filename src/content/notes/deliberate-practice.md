Deliberate practice is structured, purposeful, and systematic. It's different from casual practice because every session has specific goals and metrics for improvement.

## Core Principles

1. Focus on specific techniques
2. Immediate feedback
3. Regular reflection and adjustment
4. Consistent schedule

## Application in Music

When practicing an instrument, break down complex pieces into manageable segments. Master each segment before moving on.
