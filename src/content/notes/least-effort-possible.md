description: Understanding the Least Effort Possible Rule and how posture affects your ability to Flow
---

Check how talented musicians play, and you’ll notice one thing: they make it look effortless. Every movement serves a purpose. Improvement in music is about incrementally tuning fine motor control skills, and good posture is the foundation for developing these skills efficiently.  

Mastery, in essence, is about creating the same musical result with the least effort possible.  

In the beginner stage, movements tend to be exaggerated. There's often tension in the hands and arms, and the body feels rigid and awkward. As you move into the development stage, the focus shifts to identifying unnecessary tension, refining movements, and building a deeper awareness of your body.  

Reaching the mastery stage is where things get transformative. Movements become efficient and minimal, execution is relaxed yet controlled, and your body finds a natural, comfortable positioning. The result? Music flows effortlessly, and the joy of playing takes center stage.

## Key Takeaway

1. Engage all your senses & Breath
2. Congratulate yourself for remembering
3. Forget 5s later
4. Realize there’s still so much more to explore and smile

### On a more practical note:
Start with a position that feels comfortable and natural. Regularly check in with your body—scan for tension while you play, and come back to your breath whenever you feel off balance.

Don’t be afraid to experiment. Try different positions, notice how posture affects your sound, and always prioritize comfort over rigid ideas of what’s "correct." Your body knows the way; you just have to listen.
