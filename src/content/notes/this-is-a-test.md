Here I'm writing myself, a note I made on my own, I could write even more, until the night fades away. I feel inspired and grounded into this discovery. This new feeling, this new experience, stepping somewhere new. Sensing something new, breathing fresh air, the fresh air of exploration and discovery, the fresh air of life. That's why I live for.
